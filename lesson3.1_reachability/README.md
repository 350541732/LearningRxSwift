# Lesson 3.1: Reachability

## Problem statement

Write an app which uses `view.backgroundColor` to reflect the state of network reachability:
* `greenColor` when reachable
* `redColor` when not reachable

You can use [problem/RxSwiftReachabilityBackgroundColorDemo](problem/RxSwiftReachabilityBackgroundColorDemo) included in this repo as a starting point.

**Note**: I have omitted the `Carthage` folder from the problem project, because it includes large binary files.  In order to use the this project, you will need to run `carthage update --platform iOS`.

## Solution

My solution is included in the [solution](solution) folder of this repo.

**Note**: I have omitted the `Carthage` folder from the solution project, because it includes large binary files.  In order to run the this project, you will need to run `carthage update --platform iOS`.

`ViewController.swift`:

```swift
```
