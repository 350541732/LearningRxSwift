# Lesson 2: RxSwiftButtonBackgroundColorDemo

## Problem statement

Make an app which:

* Has a button
* Changes the view's background color to green when the button is pressed.

Use (problem/RxSwiftButtonBackgroundColorDemo)[problem/RxSwiftButtonBackgroundColorDemo] included in this repo as a starting point.

## Solution

My solution is included in the [solution](solution) folder of this repo.

**Note**: I have omitted the `Carthage` folder from the solution, because it includes large binary files.  In order to run the solution, you will need to run `carthage update --platform iOS`.
